	// Test that the main function exists and is callable
	// Since main() doesn't return anything and runs an interactive loop,
	// we can't easily test it directly. This test just verifies
	// that the main package compiles correctly.

	// We could test individual functions if they were exported,
	// but since they're not, we'll just verify basic compilation
	t.Log("Main package compiles successfully")

func TestPackageImports(t *testing.T) {
	// Test that all required packages are properly imported
	// This is more of a compilation test than a runtime test

	// The fact that this test runs means all imports are resolved correctly
	t.Log("All package imports are resolved correctly")

// Note: For better testing of the main package, consider:
// 1. Extracting core logic into exported functions
// 2. Creating integration tests that test the CLI interface
// 3. Using dependency injection to make components more testable
